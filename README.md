# GenomePy
A functional and simple python library for genomics

This project has two principle components: The genome module, which contains many useful functions and classes for genomic analyses; and the genome_tools script, which has lots of useful tools and wrappers for genomic analyses. The genome_tools_config library is actually basically just a list of paths for genome_tools to use. If all the programs that you'll be calling through genome_tools are in the system PATH, then you don't need to modify genome_tools_config and you're good to go. Otherwise, just open genome_tools_config.py in a text editor, add paths to the programs after the "=" signs, and then save in with the same name and in the same directory. Make sure all three files (genome.py, genome_tools.py, and genome_tools_config.py) are in the same directory as each other!
