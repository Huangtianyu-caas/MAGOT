Priority1:
Converting annotation formats
    currently can read: Apollo-compatable GFF3 NCBI GFF3, augustus GTF, RepeatMasker GTF, exonerate default output, blast CSV
    currently can write: Apollo-compatable GFF3, augustus hint
    would like to read: BED, Genbank
    would like to write: GTF, BED, Genbank
Getting sequences from annotations (CDS, translated peptide, genomic locus, genomic locus with buffer, upstream, downstream)
add/merge annotations
Performing set opperations on annotations
Output to specialized files (e.g. Apollo-style integrated gff+fasta)

Priority2:
Calculating statistics about annotations (e.g. sequence content, % overlap with other annotations)
Other annotation manipulations (e.g. change feature type en-mass, give intermediate parent (exon between CDS/UTR and transcript)- both necessary for say converting GTF to NCBI GFF3)
