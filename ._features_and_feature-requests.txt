Priority1:
Converting annotation formats
Getting sequences from annotations (CDS, translated peptide, genomic locus, genomic locus with buffer, upstream, downstream)
add/merge annotations
Performing set opperations on annotations

Priority2:
Calculating statistics about annotations (e.g. sequence content, % overlap with other annotations)
Other annotation manipulations (e.g. change feature type en-mass, give intermediate parent (exon between CDS/UTR and transcript))
